#General Video Script
## Exun 2019 Logo flashes/Intro
Blue box appears, white text('exun') pops out of the box, small black box expands to occupy size, the thickness recedes revealing 2019
### Alternate
Exun Clan pops out of ground in similar manner, then bases of buildings in surrounding pop out (or we could keep this from the starting), construction follows(timelapse), construction finishes and daily life is shown, with functioning utilities and running cars, Sun passes over city.
Camera passes over Times Square-like area
## Events
Show events introduction
### 2D AV route
Usual cool and aesthetic animations and transitions
### 3D Route
3D transitions, using scaling of objects/shape keys for ex X component expands to fill size of screen and background changes accordingly to that color(for immersion)
Event-wise:
1) Programming- PC kept aside monitor which has code compiling and executing
2) Creative- An art board, across which a paintbnrush lays a streak
3) Quizzing- Buzzer which is activated, sends electronic pulse(visible), screen shows text('junior quiz') before buzzer, text('senior quiz') after signal, OR just a desk with buzzer on top, the button is smashed in, the buzzer lights up, the desk has text('Junior/Senior Quiz') on its front, directly visible
4) Hardware-Rapid PC assembly
5) Turing test- Showing one of Alan Turing's bombs in operation, "ticking"
6) Spacetech- Open field launch(possibly using low poly model)
7) Crossword- Some sort of 3D grid maybe?
8) Group Discussion- A proper podium/mike is shown, camera zooms out and goes into top view, a placard says text('Group Discussion')
#### Alternate
All this can be in a single hall, kind of like a fair/expo. Maybe ðŸ˜® we could keep this inside the Exun Clan building. The app/sudocrypt/other announcements can be made in the large screen in the hall, imagine rows of these components, parallel to each other and perpendicular to the screen
### 3D/2D Route
2D transitions standard, fade in, the multiple expanding circles, pane entering & covering, combined with 3D scenes.
## Ending
If doing the hall idea, we could end it by exiting the hall and showing the Exun Clan city as epilogue with the Sun setting instead, making end of event
